# CSCI 355 Assignment 3: Sorting
##### Andy Jang 9/25/2022

The purpose of this program is to implement merge sorting in both python3 and perl.
This was to compare the readability, writability, and expressiveness of both languages.

## How to Run the Code
#### Python 3
To run the Python3 program, all you have to do is run:
`python3 mergeSort.py`
Running the program will ask for user input for the numbers to be sorted.

#### Perl
To run the perl program, run:
`perl mergeSort.pl`
Running the program will ask for user input to same way the python3 version does.
